These spirits, once protectors of the amulet, now hold the secrets to its location and the means to dispel the curse. As Ellen ventures into the heart of the forbidden forest, she must use her mind-reading abilities to navigate through the minds of the wise but elusive Tree Spirits. Each spirit presents her with a unique challenge, testing her intellect, empathy, and magical prowess. Some may try to deceive her, while others might share crucial information in cryptic riddles. Ellen must use her wit and intuition to unravel their hidden motives and intentions. Moreover, lurking within the shadows of the forest are dark forces seeking to claim the amulet for their own malevolent purposes. Ellen must tread carefully, as her every thought could be intercepted by the sinister creatures that seek to exploit her powers for their gain."
